ACCEPT EXTRA CREDIT #1
Implement the Class Time from Figures 9.1 and 9.2 in the book
Class Time:
Add to Time a method void load(const string& s);
The method takes a string (see format) and parses it to load the time object. In other words, the load method will take a string then, split it into substrings, and assign these values to the current Time object
must use stringstream
Override the operator<< for Time, which takes a ostream (so it can be printed to the console and saved to a file).
friend can be used, but implementation must be provided on Time.cpp
Main program:
Has a vector of Time*
Prompts an input filename from the user
Read the file, then:
For each line, it creates a Time object (ptr)
Calls its load method and pastes the line as a parameter
Save that object to the vector created above
Then, ask the user for an output filename.
For each Time object, save to the output file the return of toUniversalStandard() of the Time, a tab, and then save the time (use operator<<) and a new line.
e.g. 20\t5\t5\n (\t represents a tab and \n a new line)
File Format
Files Format: The file has one line per time
Input file: hours minutes seconds (using space as delimiter)
e.g.: 14 20 3
Output file: HH:MM:SS PM/AM hours minutes seconds (using \t to separate universal time from the time files. Time fields use space as delimiter)
e.g.: 02:20:03 PM\t14 20 3
